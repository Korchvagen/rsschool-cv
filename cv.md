**Briefly About Myself:**

I started my career as a programmer from the moment I entered the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics. Now I am studying in the third year of the Faculty of Computer-Aided Design, majoring in Engineering-Psychological Maintenance of Information Technologies.

I have chosen for myself, that I will study Web Development. I study Frontend Development, because I like to work with the design, to carry out the project so, that it is comfortable to use. In my free time, I do self-study and study at the RSSchoole course.

I believe, that my skills and perseverance will help me achieve my goals and I will become a successful frontend developer.
